    <p>I'm Tad Sharp. I'm a web developer and a cyber penetration tester.</p>
    <p>I was taught most of my skills at the Davis Catalyst Center, which was an amazing opportunity. I worked with real clients, building websites from scratch or through tools like Squarespace.</p>
    <p>The gnomes giggled to themselves as they watched the travelers stumble around in the dark, trying to find their belongings. But the travelers were good-natured and took the prank in stride, even joining in on the laughter.</p>
    <p>After the initial shock and confusion passed, the gnomes and the travelers began to talk and get to know each other. The gnomes shared stories of their pranks and the travelers shared tales of their adventures. As the night went on, the travelers realized that they had made new friends in the form of these mischievous little creatures.</p>
